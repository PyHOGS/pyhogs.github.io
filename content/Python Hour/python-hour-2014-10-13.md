authors: J.Paul Rinehimer

There was no meeting today as only Jim and JPaul showed up.

In other news, if you need a new battery for a MacBook Pro, post mid-2009 model, the [U-District MacStore](http://www.themacstore.com/locations/seattle) can do it in-house in around 15 - 25 minutes for a very reasonable price.  No need to send it off to Apple.  Just remember to call first to make sure they have the battery!
