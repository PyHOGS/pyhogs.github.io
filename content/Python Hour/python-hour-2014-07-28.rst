:summary: We talked about indexing, slicing and the awesomeness of the iPython Notebook

We mainly talked about array indexing and slicing. Basically, we discussed the
different ways we can call a subset of an array. We were more or less following
`Jake's notebook <{filename}/How%20to.../slicing-and-indexing.md>`_ .

Other things that we discussed:

* `iPython Notebook <http://ipython.org/notebook.html>`_: The Notebook is a way to log a Python session and export it
  as document - see Jake's file. Text can be entered using plain text, markdown,
  html or LaTex Math syntax. You can also export the Notebook in a bunch of
  different formats including Latex and html. JPaul and I think it would be
  good way to share notes with the group.
  
* Creating a `Github <https://github.com/>`_ repository for the group: Everyone seems to agree that it
  would be convenient to have a centralized place where we can share and access
  each other's code and notebooks. A github repository seems ideal. It's
  contents would be accessible to everyone and each of us can contribute to
  its content. I created a `personal repository for my notes. <https://github.com/earlew/Python_demo>`_
  Someone could create a separate repo for the group in a similar way.
