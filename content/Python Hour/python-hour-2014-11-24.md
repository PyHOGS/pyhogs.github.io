### Meeting Summary

Today we talked about using Python in the classroom. Parker is planning to teach his Puget Sound oceanography course next quarter and hopes to give his students the chance to explore data and model output using Python. The challenge is that most students will have little to no prior programming experience and Parker cannot afford to spend too much class time teaching the language.


Michelle advised that a few instructional sessions will be necessary. She described these sessions as an opportunity for students to interact with some simple, pre-written code as the instructor guides them through the important concepts. I supported this idea and suggested borrowing some ideas from the [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) teaching lab. Their teaching philosphy is to empower learners by introducing them to interesting yet instructive examples that they will find immediately useful. We all seemed to agree that teaching the fundamentals of the language, without providing interesting applications, will likely disengage students.

Parker asked about how to interpolate from one 2-D plaid grid to another. I suggested using the [scipy.interpolate.interp2d](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.14.0/reference/generated/scipy.interpolate.interp2d.html) function.
