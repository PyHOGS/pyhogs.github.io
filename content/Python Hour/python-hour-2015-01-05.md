##Meeting summary
This was the first meeting of Winter quarter 2015. There were several graduate students in attendance for the first time - a few of them from [SAFS](http://fish.washington.edu/). After the group did a round of introductions, Earle gave a quick overview of PyHOGs, and the group's website and github account. Afterwards, we opened the floor to general questions and solicited suggestions for future meeting topics. We also settled on a meeting time/place for this quarter: **Mondays at 10am in OSB 310.**
