##Meeting summary
There was no agenda for this meeting so we reverted to our usual open discussion format. 

* Someone asked about online Python courses and a few people mentioned that Coursera has offered [several Python courses](https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=python) in the past. Jesse recommended taking the [high performance scientific computing course](https://www.coursera.org/course/scicomp) hosted by UW. Earle also refered to the Software Carpentry [lessons page](http://software-carpentry.org/lessons.html) as another good online resource.

* The topic of git and version control came up again. This time, Dan gave a nice demo of how he combines git and dropbox to log the edits he makes to his Ph.D. thesis.

* JPaul gave a demo on how to make a simple line plot using matplotlib. He also introduced the [GridSpec](http://matplotlib.org/users/gridspec.html) module as a convenient tool for customizing subplots.
