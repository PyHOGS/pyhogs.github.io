## Website for University of Washington Python Hour for Oceanography and GeoSciences.

This repository hosts the PyHOGS Organization webpage. If you're reading this 
file, you're on the `master` branch of the repository.  This branch hosts the 
website content and is automatically generated by the 
[pelican static site generator](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.4.0/)
and [ghp-import](https://github.com/davisp/ghp-import).

If you'd like to view or edit the source, switch to the `pelican-source` branch
which hosts the source files that generate the website.
