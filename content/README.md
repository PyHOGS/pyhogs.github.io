## Website for Python Hour for Oceanography and GeoSciences.

This repository hosts the PyHOGS Organization webpage. If you're reading this 
file, you're on the `master` branch of the repository.  This branch hosts the 
website content and is automatically generated by the 
[pelican static site generator](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.4.0/)
and [ghp-import](https://github.com/davisp/ghp-import).

If you'd like to view or edit the source, switch to the `pelican-source` branch
which hosts the source files that generate the website.


## Wrapper file for posting notebooks to the website

For posting ipython notebooks to the website, a file is needed that contains metadata for the post.  This wrapper file is written in markdown (.md) and consists of the following content:

    Title: TEMPLATE
    Slug: FEW-WORDS-WITH-NO-SPACES
    Date: 2015-01-01 00:00 UTC-07:00

    Summary: BRIEF DESCRIPTION.

    [INSERT MARKDOWN TEXT, AND/OR LINK TO A IPYTHON NOTEBOOK AS BELOW]

    {% notebook examples/sample_notebook.ipynb%}

Give it a name similar to the name of your notebook with an extension of `.md`.
