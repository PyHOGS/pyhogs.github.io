Summary: A tutorial of how to post to the PyHOGS website: making an iPython Notebook and supporting files and adding them to the PyHOGS GitHub repository.


# How to post to PyHOGS

This is a basic tutorial describing how to create iPython Notebooks and uploading them to the PyHOGS GitHub repository for sharing with the group.  There is a recent [Nature Toolbox article](http://www.nature.com/news/interactive-notebooks-sharing-the-code-1.16261 "Nature Toolbox: interactive notebooks sharing the code") on iPython Notebooks that may be of interest.  See the companion post "Using GitHub for PyHOGS" for more details on setting up and using GitHub.

The easiest way to add content is to email it directly to JPaul or Earle, who maintain the PyHOGS GitHub repository.  They'll still ask you to provide the necessary files (a notebook file and a markdown wrapper).

Alternatively, if you want to learn new software or want to contribute more regularly, you can learn how to work with GitHub.  This is the pathway I describe here.  The steps involved are:

* Write the notebook in iPython Notebook.
* Add the notebook to your local private repository.
* Push your local changes to your forked PyHOGS GitHub repository.
* Create a pull request to the PyHOGS main repository to ask the maintainers to add your additions.


## Making an iPython Notebook

Having installed the Enthought Canopy version of python on my computer (OS 10.8), I simply run

    ipython notebook &
to open the notebook editor in the active browser window.  Create a new notebook to start editing.

Notebooks are arranged as cells, where each cell is either a comment in markdown format or a series of input commands for ipython.  You can create new cells (under the menu item Insert), and the pull-down menu lets you change between code or markdown.  By running a cell (the play button, or press shift+enter), the commands are processed: either for markdown formatting or to run the python code and display the output (if any) at the end of the cell.

To get started with markdown, here are a few commands:
- `#` generates a header, and using two `##` (or three, ...) makes subheaders.
- lists are generated by multiple lines beginning with `-` or `+` or `*`
- emphasis/italics is made by `_xxx_` or `*xxx*`.
- bold is made by `__xxx__` or `**xxx**`.
- in-text code is bracketed by backward apostrophe, e.g. `` `command` `` gives `command` 
- multiple lines of block code is made by lines starting with a tab (the entire block preceded by a blank line)

Additional nice features is that it understands latex math formatting and can include links and images.  More details can be found [here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax "markdown formatting").

Assume that you've now written up a test notebook `sample.ipynb` and want to get it onto the PyHOGS website.  Make sure it is located in the notebook folder of the PyHOGS repository (`pyhogs.github.io/pyhogs-code/notebooks/examples/`).



## Files for the PyHOGS website

Though the PyHOGS repository can take notebooks directly, to add a webpage a wrapper file is needed to supply metadata for the post.

For tutorials in the [how-to section](http://pyhogs.github.io/category/how-to.html "PyHOGS website How To"), these wrapper files are in `pyhogs.github.io/content/How\ to.../`.  They are written in markdown (`.md`) and look like this

    Title: Colormap example for bathymetry
    Slug: colormap-bathymetry
    Date: 2014-11-04 13:12 UTC-07:00
    Authors: ZB Szuts
    Tags: color, colormap, jet, bathymetry
    Summary: An example of making a map with filled bathymetric contours in matplotlib.
    
    {% notebook examples/Colormap_bathy.ipynb%}
    pyhogs.github.io/content/How\ to.../colormap_bathy.md (END) 

Just copy one of the existing files and modify to suit.  Call it `sample.md` and put it the above directory.


## Contributing to the PyHOGS repository

Your local changes need to be propagated (pushed) to your personal repository and then to the master repository.  It's important to make sure your distribution and local copy are fully up to date/synced with the master repository before the steps below are followed.  (See companion post "Using GitHub for PyHOGS".)

The steps are

1. add the file to the local repository
1. record the change to the local repository
1. push the file from the local repository to your online private repository
1. generate a pull request to ask the maintainers to pull the change into the master repository

These steps need to be done for both the notebook and the wrapper files.  

    cd ~/Documents/pyhogs/pyhogs.github.io/content/How\ to.../
    git add sample.md
    git commit -m "Add a sample wrapper" sample.md
    
    cd ~/Documents/pyhogs/pyhogs.github.io/pyhogs-code/notebooks/examples/
    git add sample.ipynb
    git commit -m "Add a notebook" sample.ipynb

The `-m` switch for `git commit` attaches a quick description of the file/changes, which is especially useful for others (e.g. the maintainers).  The third step only needs to be run once

    git push

to push all outstanding changes to your local repository to your forked version of pyhogs.github.io on GitHub.

Now go online to your private repository.  Click the Pull Request button to ask the maintainers to accept your change.  It's good practice to add a comment that describes the new files or the changes.  Once these changes are accepted, your content will be added to the PyHOGS website!


## Comments

Note that it's not required to submit an iPython Notebok file.  If you don't need any python execution, then you can simply write in markdown (as done for this post).  Or, I'm sure, in other web suitable formats (see companion post on using GitHub).
