###What is PyHOGs?

PyHOGs stands for Python Hour for Oceanographers and Geoscientists. As the name implies, we are a group of geoscientists that meet for about an hour every week to share and discuss Python related ideas. Our group consists of students, post-docs and faculty from the University of Washington - mainly, the [School of Oceanography](http://www.ocean.washington.edu/). We tend to discuss the kind of problems that researchers in our field encounter on a regular basis. Our discussions are usually unstructured and free flowing but, occassionally, someone will present a short demo on a specific topic. Meetings are always informal. Everyone is encouraged to ask questions and share ideas. **PyHOGs welcomes all Python users, especially beginners.**
