summary: About the PyHOGs

###What is PyHOGs?

PyHOGs stands for Python Hour for Oceanographers and Geoscientists. We are a group of researchers, from the University of Washington, that meets regularly to share and discuss Python related ideas. We tend to discuss the kind of problems that researchers in our field encounter on a regular basis. Our discussions are usually unstructured and free flowing. Occassionally, someone will present short demo on a specific topic but, even then, our always are very informal. Everyone is encouraged to ask questions and share ideas. **PyHOGs welcomes all Python users, especially beginners.**
