If you are completely new to Python, this is a good place to start. Here, we will show you to how to get Python and introduce you to all the important scientific packages for doing research in the geosciences. If you don't want to read this entire post, just scroll to the bottom.

###Getting Python
The standard way is to get Python is to download the source code from the main website <https://www.python.org/>. The installation instructions are straight forward and should only take a few minutes. If you are using a Mac, you probably already have Python installed on your computer. To check, open up a Terminal window and type `Python`. Doing this should bring up a Python welcome message and a new prompt denoted by >>. Note that this pre-installed version of Python may not be the most up to date. 

Once you have Python installed, all you need is a text editor and you are good to go. However, at this point, you will only have access to the Python Standard Library and not any of the important scientific computational packages. 

###Getting important scientific packages

The [SciPy Stack](http://www.scipy.org/about.html) is a curated collection of the major scientific packages available for Python. The SciPy Stack includes **NumPy, Scipy and Matplotlib**, which are the fundamental Python packages for numerical computation and data visualization. Also included in the SciPy Stack is [Ipython](http://ipython.org/), which offers a powerful interactive shell and a browser based Notebook that allows supports code, mathematical expressions and markdown language. IPython is a *major* upgrade over the standard Python command line interface.

There are a number of ways to install the SciPy Stack. Instructions for doing so are available [here](http://www.scipy.org/install.html). The site recommends that you install the SciPy Stack via one of several Python distributions. Most of these distributions come with their own version of Python, which will be installed separately from any pre-installed Python, all the packages from the SciPy Stack and dozens more scientific pacakages. 

The [Enthought Canopy](https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/) distribution seems to be a favorite among users in our group. In addition to having all the key scientific packages, Canopy has an easy-to-use (Matlab-like) graphical user interface (GUI) and uses Ipython as the default command line interface. IPython Notebooks can be hosted within the Canopy GUI as well. Canopy also has an excellent series of video tutorials, which you can access on their website. Be sure to request an [academic license](https://store.enthought.com/#canopy-academic). This gives you access to all of Canopy's features for free. 

####Getting the Seawater toolbox
If you are coming from MATLAB, you are probably already familiar with the seawater toolbox. This toolbox is available in Python as well. Instructions for installing the Gibbs SeaWater toolbox and the older CSIRO toolbox can be found in this [PyHOGs meeting summary](python-hour-2014-08-18).


###Learning more
There are many excellent (free) Python tutorials available online. For simple explanations of basic Python features, <http://www.learnpython.org/> and <http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/index.htm> are good starting points. When you are ready to dive into Python's scientific computing capabilities, Enthought's Python [video lectures](https://training.enthought.com/#/courses) are excellent. The videos are geared towards scientists and engineers and offer introductions to iPython, Numpy and Matplotlib. 

For more earth science specific help, there is this website (of course) and the others listed in the useful links side bar on the left.

It's worth noting that Python has a large and active user community and that Google is your friend. Most google queries about a specific Python question will bring up results from [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python) forum. If you have a Python-related question, chances are that your question has already been asked and thoroughly discussed on that forum. 

For everything else there is PyHOGs! Please come to our meetings with any questions you may have. For updates and meeting notices, please join our [mailing list](https://mailman1.u.washington.edu/mailman/listinfo/pyhogs)
