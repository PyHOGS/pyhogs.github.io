## Good git and github tutorials

### Git

http://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial THE git tutorial. A decent introduction.

This site also hosts the free, online book Pro Git, which, despite it's title and depth of content, is remarkably readable and a good beginner book.  

Atlassian makes my standard git-gui, SourceTree.  Their git tutorial is good, but can use jargon without properly presenting it.
https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorial Their Workflows overview https://www.atlassian.com/git/workflows is a great
look at the variety of ways you can use git to manage your project

http://gitimmersion.com/  Commands and output you can try on your own.
http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/  A "comic-style" overview ... just keep
scrolling.
