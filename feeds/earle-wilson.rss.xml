Basically, we discussed the
different ways we can call a subset of an array. We were more or less following
Jake's notes that can be viewed here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other things that we discussed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iPython Notebook: The Notebook is a way to log a Python session and export it
as document - see Jake's file. Text can be entered using plain text, markdown,
html or LaTex Math syntax. You can also export the Notebook in a bunch of
different formats including Latex and html. JPaul and I think it would be
good way to share notes with the group.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating a Github repository for the group: Everyone seems to agree that it
would be convenient to have a centralized place where we can share and access
each other's code and notebooks. A github repository seems ideal. It's
contents would be accessible to everyone and each of us can contribute to
its content. I created a personal repository for my notes:
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/earlew/Python_demo"&gt;https://github.com/earlew/Python_demo&lt;/a&gt;. Someone could create a separate repo
for the group in a similar way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
